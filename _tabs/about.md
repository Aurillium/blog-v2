I'm Memphis Marshall, a SOC analyst at [Seamless Intelligence](https://seamlessintelligence.com.au/) in Perth, Western Australia and graduate from [Edith Cowan University](https://www.ecu.edu.au/). I have a strong interest for cybersecurity and software development, I enjoy CTFs and HackTheBox in my spare time, plus researching and experimenting with new exploits. I'm a big supporter of open source, though I don't often get time to contribute back to the projects I use, but most code I write for fun is available for others to use. I believe software and cybersecurity should be accessible to all and enjoy the opportunity to educate and learn from others in the field. If if you have any questions or comments on what I do, feel free to contact me.

## Projects

- **[Invisirun](https://github.com/Aurillium/Invisirun)** - an alternative version of commandline spoofing using `NtCreateUserProcess`
- **[LunaJuice](https://github.com/Aurillium/LunaJuice)** - a tool worked on during my internship that can connect to suspicious processes and monitor/change their behaviour

Both of these will eventually be written into blog posts for those who are interested.
